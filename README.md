- 👋 Hi, I’m @FarizAhmadBZ
- 👀 I’m interested in game programming, but...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web and java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now,
  that's because I'm still learning at anything from scratch, I'm still zero to collab on your projects
- 📫 How to reach me? Nope
  ...or maybe just contact me at discord, FarzBZ987#0968.
  I'm not accepting discord friend request, so just DM me if you want to. 
- Oh, also, this is my school account, my real account is on github.com/FarzBZ987
